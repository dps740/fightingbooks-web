## 5. Draft Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Cold DM to Micro-Influencer (Casual)

> **Subject/Opening:** Hey [Name]! 👋
> 
> I've been following your content on [homeschooling/kids' activities/reading] and love what you share — especially [reference specific recent post].
> 
> I'm working on something I think your audience would genuinely love: **Who Would Win Books** (whowouldwinbooks.com) — it's a site where kids pick two animals and AI creates a fully illustrated battle book comparing them. Think the Jerry Pallotta "Who Would Win?" series but personalized and on-demand.
> 
> Kids learn about animal habitats, diets, sizes, and special abilities while reading a book THEY chose. It's $3.99 for a one-time unlock (not a subscription) and there are 47 animals + a Choose Your Own Adventure mode.
> 
> **I'd love to give you free access** so your kids can try it. If they enjoy it, I'd be grateful for an honest review — no obligations at all. Just want to get it in front of families who'd actually use it.
> 
> Want me to set you up? 🙂
> 
> — David

### Template 2: Email to Teacher Blogger (Professional)

> **Subject:** Review opportunity: AI-powered animal battle books for young readers
> 
> Hi [Name],
> 
> I'm David, creator of **Who Would Win Books** (whowouldwinbooks.com) — an educational platform where children create personalized illustrated books comparing real animals in head-to-head matchups.
> 
> **How it works:** Kids pick two animals (from 47 options), and our AI generates a fully illustrated book covering each animal's habitat, diet, physical attributes, and special abilities — then determines a winner based on real science. It's designed to build:
> - **Vocabulary** (scientific terms in context)
> - **Comparison & critical thinking** skills
> - **Reading engagement** (kids CHOOSE what they read)
> - **Science knowledge** (real animal facts)
> 
> The platform is a one-time $3.99 unlock (no subscription, no ads) and includes both standard and Choose Your Own Adventure modes.
> 
> **I'd love to offer you:**
> - ✅ Free full access for review
> - ✅ An affiliate partnership (commission on signups you refer)
> - ✅ A guest post or interview if you're interested
> 
> Given your audience of [parents/educators/homeschoolers], I think this could be a genuinely useful resource for families looking for educational screen time that doesn't feel like busywork.
> 
> Would you be open to checking it out? Happy to answer any questions or hop on a quick call.
> 
> Best,
> David Smith
> whowouldwinbooks.com

### Template 3: Facebook Group Post (Value-First, Soft CTA)

> **Post Title/Hook:** 🦁 vs 🐻 My kids can't stop comparing animals — here's the free worksheet we made!
> 
> My [son/daughter] has been obsessed with the "Who Would Win?" books lately, so we turned it into a learning activity. I made a **free animal comparison worksheet** where kids research two animals and compare their:
> 
> 📏 Size & weight
> 🏠 Habitat
> 🍖 Diet
> ⚡ Speed & special abilities
> 
> Then they write a persuasive paragraph about who would win and WHY (great for CCSS informational writing standards!).
> 
> **Download the free worksheet here:** [link to free PDF or TPT freebie]
> 
> If your kids love it as much as mine did, we also discovered this cool site (whowouldwinbooks.com) where they can create their OWN illustrated animal battle books with AI — it's been our favorite "educational screen time" find this year. 
> 
> What two animals would YOUR kids want to see battle? Drop them below! 👇

**Notes on the Facebook template:**
- Lead with VALUE (free worksheet), not a sales pitch
- The CTA is casual and secondary
- The question at the end drives engagement (algorithm loves comments)
- Adjust tone to match each group's culture (some are more casual, some more academic)

## Key Insights

1. **The "Who Would Win" concept has massive built-in demand** — Jerry Pallotta's book series is beloved by teachers. TPT has 8,300+ results. This isn't a cold sell; it's riding an existing wave.

2. **Homeschool Facebook groups are the highest-volume opportunity** — Groups with 50K-117K members posting 1,000+ times/month. These parents actively seek educational tools.

3. **TPT as a funnel is underutilized and free** — A well-made free worksheet could drive hundreds/thousands of visits from teachers who already understand the concept.

4. **Micro-influencers (5K-50K) will likely work for free product** — No need for paid sponsorships. Offer free access for honest review. Target 5-10 and 2-3 will likely say yes.

5. **"Educational screen time" is the killer angle** — Parents feel guilt about screen time. Positioning as "the screen time you don't have to feel bad about" resonates deeply with this audience.
