## What Are the Who Would Win? Books?

Created by author **Jerry Pallotta** and illustrator **Rob Bolster**, the Who Would Win? series launched in 2006 with *Killer Whale vs. Great White Shark*. The formula is simple but brilliant:

1. **Meet Fighter #1** — Facts about the first animal (size, habitat, diet, special abilities)
2. **Meet Fighter #2** — Same treatment for the opponent  
3. **Tale of the Tape** — Side-by-side comparison
4. **The Battle** — A narrative showdown based on real animal capabilities
5. **The Winner** — Who comes out on top, and why

Each book is about 32 pages with vibrant illustrations, perfect for kids ages 6-10. They're educational disguised as entertainment — kids absorb animal facts without realizing they're learning.

## Best Reading Order

**Good news:** There's no required reading order! Each book is standalone. That said, here are some approaches:

### By Interest
- **Dinosaur fans:** Start with T-Rex vs. Velociraptor, then the Dinosaur Rumble
- **Ocean lovers:** Killer Whale vs. Great White Shark → Ultimate Ocean Rumble
- **Bug enthusiasts:** Tarantula vs. Scorpion → Hornet vs. Wasp → Ultimate Bug Rumble
- **Big cats:** Lion vs. Tiger → Jaguar vs. Skunk

### By Reading Level
- **Emerging readers (ages 5-6):** Any single-battle book (simpler narrative)
- **Confident readers (ages 7-8):** The Rumble books (more animals, longer)
- **Advanced (ages 9-10):** All books + encourage them to research and debate the outcomes

### The "Greatest Hits" Starter Pack
If buying a set, these are the fan favorites:
1. Lion vs. Tiger (the classic debate)
2. Killer Whale vs. Great White Shark (started it all)
3. Polar Bear vs. Grizzly Bear (surprisingly close)
4. Tyrannosaurus Rex vs. Velociraptor (Jurassic nostalgia)
5. Ultimate Ocean Rumble (great variety)
