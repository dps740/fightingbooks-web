## Meet the Fighters

### The Hyena

The spotted hyena (*Crocuta crocuta*) is a remarkable carnivore found in the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of Africa. Known for their cleverness and social behavior, these animals live in clans that can boast up to 80 members! Hyenas are often misunderstood and have a reputation for scavenging, but they are skilled hunters in their own right.

**Physical Stats:**
- **Weight:** Up to 190 pounds
- **Length / Height:** Up to 4.5 feet tall at the shoulder and 5.5 to 6.5 feet long! That's about as long as a small sedan!
- **Top Speed:** Can run up to 37 miles per hour! That's faster than a speeding car in a school zone!
- **Bite Force / Strength:** 1,100 PSI!

**Weapons:**
- Powerful jaws with a bite force of 1,100 PSI!
- Sharp claws

**Fighting Style:**
Hyenas are known for their teamwork and pack behavior. They often hunt in groups, using their intelligence to outsmart prey. In a fight, they rely on their powerful jaws and sharp claws, attacking with ferocity and stamina. When faced with a threat, their strategy usually involves intimidation and outnumbering their opponent, rather than direct confrontation.

### The Velociraptor

The velociraptor (*Velociraptor mongoliensis*) was a small but fearsome dinosaur that roamed the dry, open areas like deserts and plains around 75 million years ago. Though popularized in movies as large, fearsome creatures, real velociraptors were about the size of a turkey! Renowned for their speed and hunting skills, they were likely pack hunters, making them even more dangerous.

**Physical Stats:**
- **Weight:** About 33 pounds
- **Length / Height:** About 6.5 feet long! That's like a small car! (A sedan is ~15 feet)!
- **Top Speed:** Top speed of 24 mph! That's faster than a human sprinter!
- **Bite Force / Strength:** (approx.) 400 PSI

**Weapons:**
- Clawed toes (up to 3 inches long)
- Sharp teeth
- Speed and agility

**Fighting Style:**
Velociraptors were incredibly agile and intelligent. They relied on their speed and sharp claws to strike quickly and effectively. In a hunt, they would often work together in packs, using coordinated attacks to bring down larger prey. Their quick reflexes and ability to change direction rapidly allowed them to dodge attacks and outmaneuver their opponents.

## The Battle

The sun sets over the African savanna, casting a golden glow on the tall grass. In the distance, a clan of spotted hyenas lounges, their powerful bodies silhouetted against the fading light. Suddenly, a rustle captures their attention. Out from the shadows emerges a lone velociraptor, its sleek body poised and ready. The hyenas, curious and cautious, circle the small dinosaur, their eyes glinting with anticipation.

With a sudden burst of energy, the velociraptor darts left, trying to escape the encroaching hyenas. But these crafty predators are not easily fooled. In a flash, one hyena lunges, jaws snapping just inches away from the raptor's tail. The velociraptor quickly pivots, using its agility to evade the attack and retaliate with a swift slash of its claws aimed at the nearest hyena's flank.

The hyena yelps in surprise, but its thick skin absorbs the blow. Undeterred, the hyena shakes off the attack and calls to its clan. The other hyenas join in, their powerful legs propelling them forward in a coordinated effort. The velociraptor, realizing it is outnumbered, tries to dodge and weave, but the hyenas are too fast and too clever.

With a sudden burst of speed, one hyena charges directly at the velociraptor, forcing it to jump sideways. This is the moment the pack has been waiting for! Another hyena closes in from the opposite side, and with a powerful leap, it tackles the raptor to the ground! The velociraptor struggles fiercely, slashing with its claws, aiming for the hyena's face.

But the hyenas are relentless. They work together, using their numbers to their advantage. The velociraptor, despite its agility, finds itself overwhelmed by the sheer strength and determination of the clan. In a final attempt to escape, it kicks out with its powerful legs, but it’s too little, too late. The hyenas have it pinned down.

With a powerful bite, the lead hyena clamps down on the velociraptor, ending the fierce struggle. The savanna returns to its serene silence, the hyenas standing victorious over their fallen opponent.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Hyena**

In this epic clash, the hyena's overwhelming size, strength, and bite force give it the upper hand. Weighing in at 190 pounds compared to the velociraptor’s 33 pounds, the hyena has a significant advantage in raw power. With a bite force of 1,100 PSI, it can easily overcome the velociraptor's (approx.) 400 PSI bite. While the velociraptor is incredibly agile and possesses sharp claws, its smaller size and lower weight make it vulnerable against a powerful pack of hyenas.

In a battle scenario, the hyena would likely win 8 out of 10 fights, using its superior strength and teamwork to overpower the raptor. However, if the velociraptor fought in a dense forest where its agility could be used to its advantage, it might stand a chance to outmaneuver and escape.
