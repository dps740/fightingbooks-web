While they usually hunt solo, they can also work together in groups to corner larger animals.

### The Ankylosaurus

The Ankylosaurus, or *Ankylosaurus magniventris*, was a formidable herbivore of the Late Cretaceous period.

## The Battle

As the sun rises over a lush riverbank, the scene is set for one of nature's most thrilling encounters. In the foreground, a massive Saltwater Crocodile glides silently through the water, its eyes just above the surface. Nearby, the Ankylosaurus grazes on ferns, oblivious to the lurking danger. 

Suddenly, the crocodile springs from the water, its powerful jaws snapping open and shut with a thunderous crash! The splash sends ripples across the river as the crocodile lunges at the unsuspecting Ankylosaurus. But this dinosaur is no easy target. With a low center of gravity and robust armor, it quickly turns to face its attacker, ready to defend itself. 

The crocodile attempts to clamp down on the Ankylosaurus's leg, but the dinosaur swings its clubbed tail with incredible force, striking the crocodile’s snout! The blow sends the crocodile reeling backward, stunned by the impact. It knows it must adjust its tactics if it wants to secure a win. Instead of a direct attack, the crocodile retreats into the water, strategizing its next move.

With the crocodile momentarily out of sight, the Ankylosaurus takes a cautious step forward. Its armored body glistens in the sunlight as it prepares for another potential assault. The crocodile, still hidden beneath the water, suddenly launches itself from the river with incredible speed, jaws open wide. This time, it aims for the Ankylosaurus's exposed side, hoping to catch it off guard.

But the Ankylosaurus is ready! It swiftly pivots, using its thick armor to deflect the crocodile’s attack. The two titans are locked in a battle of wills, with the crocodile trying to outmaneuver the heavily armored dinosaur. The Ankylosaurus counters by swinging its clubbed tail again, this time aiming for the crocodile's vulnerable underbelly.

The clash continues, with the crocodile alternating between quick strikes and retreating into the water, while the Ankylosaurus stands its ground, using its natural defenses to fend off the predator. Each moment feels like an eternity as they struggle for dominance, showcasing the raw power and instincts that define their species.

Finally, with a decisive swing of its tail, the Ankylosaurus lands a powerful blow against the crocodile. The impact sends the reptile tumbling back into the water, where it finally decides to retreat. The ancient dinosaur, victorious, stands strong on the riverbank, a true testament to its formidable defenses and fighting style.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Ankylosaurus**

In this epic battle, the Ankylosaurus emerges as the victor, thanks to its incredible defenses and powerful tail. While the Saltwater Crocodile boasts a formidable bite force of 3,700 pounds, its attempts to breach the Ankylosaurus's thick armor proved futile. The crocodile's speed in the water was impressive, allowing it to launch surprise attacks, but the dinosaur's tough exterior and clubbed tail were too much for it to handle. 

Overall, we can estimate that in about 7 out of 10 encounters, the Ankylosaurus would come out on top. Its ability to withstand attacks and retaliate with its heavy tail gives it a significant advantage in this matchup. However, if the fight were to take place in the water, the crocodile might change the odds. In an aquatic environment, its speed and ambush tactics could potentially overwhelm the Ankylosaurus, flipping the victory in its favor.
