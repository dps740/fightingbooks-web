## The Battle

In the heart of a sun-soaked savanna, the tension builds as the spotted hyena prowls through the tall grass, its keen senses on high alert. Meanwhile, the manticore lurks in the shadows, its lion-like body blending seamlessly with its surroundings. The air crackles with the anticipation of an epic confrontation.

Suddenly, the hyena spots movement and lets out an eerie laugh, echoing across the plains. The manticore, intrigued by the sound, emerges from its hiding spot. With a quick flick of its tail, it sends a venomous spike flying through the air, narrowly missing the hyena, who dodges to the side with incredible speed.

The hyena, recognizing the danger, quickly closes the distance. With its powerful jaws, it lunges at the manticore's exposed flank. However, the manticore is agile, twisting its body to evade the attack while countering with a swipe of its sharp claws, which catch the hyena on its side. The hyena yelps but doesn't back down; its thick skin is built for endurance.

As the battle rages on, the hyena uses its superior speed to circle the manticore, looking for an opening. The manticore, realizing it's outmatched in speed, tries to outsmart the hyena by mimicking the sound of a wounded animal, hoping to lure the hyena into a false sense of security. But the hyena, experienced in hunting, remains cautious, not falling for the trick.

With a burst of energy, the hyena charges again, aiming for the manticore's neck. This time, the manticore anticipates the move, and with a swift flick of its tail, it launches multiple venomous spikes at the hyena. One strikes true, hitting the hyena in the shoulder. The hyena stumbles, feeling the effects of the venom coursing through its veins.

Despite the pain, the hyena's instincts kick in, and it fights back ferociously. With its powerful jaws, it delivers a bone-crushing bite to the manticore's leg. The manticore roars in pain, realizing that this hyena is not an easy prey. The battle seems to hang in the balance as both creatures display their relentless determination.

In a final desperate attempt, the manticore tries to retreat and regroup, but the hyena, fueled by adrenaline, charges forward. With a powerful leap, it tackles the manticore to the ground, using its weight and strength to pin the legendary beast. The manticore struggles, but the hyena's powerful jaws clamp down, and the fight comes to an end.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Hyena**

In this fierce battle, the hyena emerges victorious! With a weight advantage and a powerful bite force of 1,100 PSI, the hyena's strength and speed ultimately proved to be decisive. The manticore, while a formidable opponent with its venomous tail and mythical prowess, was unable to withstand the relentless attack of the hyena, especially once it succumbed to the effects of the venom from its own tail.

If this battle were to take place in a dense forest, where the manticore could use its speed and agility to maneuver through the trees, it might have a better chance. In that environment, the manticore's cunning tactics could potentially turn the tide in its favor. But in the open savanna, the hyena's speed and fighting experience made all the difference.
