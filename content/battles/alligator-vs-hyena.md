## Meet the Fighters

### The Alligator

The American alligator, scientifically known as *Alligator mississippiensis*, is a true heavyweight of the animal kingdom. Found in swamps, rivers, and lakes throughout the southeastern United States, these reptiles are formidable hunters and highly adaptable to their environments. With their tough, armored skin and powerful jaws, they’ve earned a reputation as one of the fiercest predators in freshwater habitats.

Alligators are ambush predators, often lying in wait beneath the water's surface until their prey comes too close. They strike with incredible speed and force, using their powerful jaws to clamp down on anything that gets too close. While they are primarily solitary hunters, they can be aggressive when defending their territory or young.

### The Hyena

The spotted hyena, or *Crocuta crocuta*, is a social carnivore found in the savannas, grasslands, and woodlands of Africa.

## The Battle

In a dramatic showdown, the alligator lies still beneath the surface of a sun-drenched swamp, its eyes barely breaking the water's surface. Nearby, a hyena saunters into view, drawn to the water's edge in search of a drink. The alligator senses movement, muscles tensing as it prepares to strike.

Suddenly, the alligator lunges, shooting out of the water like a torpedo! Its powerful jaws snap shut, just inches from the unsuspecting hyena, who narrowly escapes the attack. The hyena, startled but quick-witted, turns and bolts away, reaching a speed of 37 mph as it races across the dry land. The alligator, impressive in its own right, can only manage 20 mph on land, but it quickly returns to the water, its home turf.

Realizing the alligator has retreated, the hyena snickers, confident and intrigued. It circles the water’s edge, looking for a chance to outsmart its opponent. With a burst of speed, the hyena darts in and out of the underbrush, trying to provoke the alligator into making a mistake. The alligator, however, is patient and waits for the perfect moment to strike again.

As the hyena gets bold, it approaches the water's edge one more time, taunting the alligator. But this time, the alligator is ready. With a powerful thrust of its tail, it launches itself from the water, jaws wide open. The hyena attempts to dodge, but the alligator's speed and strength are undeniable. It clamps down on the hyena with its crushing bite force of 2,125 PSI, overpowering the smaller predator.

The hyena fights back, using its sharp claws and powerful legs to scratch and kick at the alligator, but the alligator’s thick skin and armor offer excellent protection. The struggle is fierce, as the hyena tries to wriggle free, but the alligator’s grip is too strong.

In a final, desperate move, the hyena uses its intelligence, rolling and twisting to escape the alligator's vice-like jaws. It manages to break free, darting away from the water, panting and exhausted. The alligator, while still a formidable opponent, has missed its chance for a clean victory.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Alligator**

In this epic battle, the American alligator emerges as the victor. With its weight of 1,000 pounds and a bite force of 2,125 PSI, the alligator's sheer strength is unmatched. Although the spotted hyena is faster, able to sprint at 37 mph, it simply cannot match the alligator's formidable size and power when it comes to a direct confrontation. In about 7 out of 10 encounters, the alligator would likely win, especially in its aquatic environment.

However, what if this battle occurred on land away from water? In that case, the hyena might have the upper hand. With its speed and agility, the hyena could take advantage of its ability to run circles around the slower alligator, using its sharp claws and pack behavior to outsmart and overwhelm. The environment plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of this fight!
