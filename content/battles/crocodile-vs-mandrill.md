The crocodile typically hunts alone, relying on sheer force and patience rather than teamwork.

## The Battle

Picture a sunlit riverbank, where the murky waters glisten under the bright sky. Suddenly, the stillness is disrupted as a massive saltwater crocodile, measuring up to 23 feet in length and weighing an astonishing 2,200 pounds, emerges from the depths like a living dinosaur. Its powerful jaws, capable of delivering a bone-crushing bite force of 3,700 pounds, are ready for action.

On the opposite bank, a troop of mandrills is foraging. Among them, a particularly bold male, with a weight of 77 pounds and standing up to 3 feet tall, notices the lurking crocodile. His vibrant face colors flash as he tries to assert dominance over the situation. His keen instincts kick in as he senses danger.

With a burst of speed, the mandrill dashes toward the trees, reaching a top speed of 25 mph—faster than the crocodile can swim! The mandrill’s lightning-fast reflexes allow him to navigate the dense underbrush with agility, but the crocodile is not far behind, propelling itself through the water at an impressive 20 mph.

Suddenly, the crocodile lunges from the water, jaws wide open, aiming for the mandrill. The mandrill, however, is quick on his feet. He dodges just in time, using his powerful arms to leap onto a low-hanging branch. From his vantage point, he can see the crocodile thrashing in the shallow water, frustrated by the missed strike.

The crocodile, undeterred, quickly recalibrates its strategy. It begins to circle the area, using the element of surprise. The mandrill, aware of the looming threat, stays alert, his bright colors flashing as he communicates with his troop. He knows that in numbers lies safety, and he calls out to his companions to create a distraction.

As the mandrills begin to move in unison, the crocodile strikes again, this time targeting the nearest mandrill. It lunges with incredible force, jaws snapping shut with a deafening crack. The mandrill narrowly escapes, darting to the side, but the distraction gives the crocodile an opportunity to retreat and reposition itself. 

The battle rages on, with the mandrill using its agility to dodge attacks while the crocodile relies on its raw power and cunning. However, the crocodile’s size and strength begin to tip the balance. With one final, powerful strike, it lunges at the mandrill, catching its leg in its jaws. The mandrill screeches in pain and tries to escape, but the crocodile’s grip is unyielding. 

With a swift motion, the crocodile drags the mandrill into the water. The mandrill struggles, but the crocodile’s superior strength is overwhelming. The battle comes to a heart-wrenching end as the crocodile claims victory.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Crocodile**

In this epic clash, the saltwater crocodile emerges as the undeniable winner. With a weight of up to 2,200 pounds and a bite force of 3,700 pounds, the crocodile's sheer power and patience give it a significant advantage. While the mandrill boasts impressive speed at 25 mph and agility, it simply cannot compete with the crocodile's brute strength and formidable weapons. In a direct confrontation, the crocodile would likely win 7 out of 10 fights, thanks to its ability to ambush and overpower its opponent.

But what if they fought in the trees, away from the crocodile's aquatic domain? In that case, the mandrill's agility and speed would shine. The mandrill could evade the crocodile's attacks by climbing and jumping to safety, potentially allowing it to outmaneuver the reptile and escape.
