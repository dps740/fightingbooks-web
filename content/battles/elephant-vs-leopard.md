With their impressive size and strength, they are often considered gentle giants, but when threatened, they can become fierce protectors of their herd.

- Trunk
- Massive body

**Fighting Style:**
Elephants typically rely on their size and strength in confrontations. When threatened, they use their tusks and massive trunks to defend themselves, often charging directly at their opponents. They can also use their intelligence to outsmart predators, creating strategies to protect their young.

### The Leopard

The leopard (*Panthera pardus*) is a powerful carnivore that inhabits the savannas, forests, and grasslands of Africa and parts of Asia. Known for their beautiful spotted fur and elusive nature, leopards are skilled hunters that rely on stealth and agility to catch their prey. With their incredible climbing abilities and tendency to drag their meals into trees, they are adept at surviving in various environments.

**Physical Stats:**
- **Weight:** Between 66 to 176 pounds

## The Battle

In an open African savanna, the sun beats down as a massive African elephant ambles through the tall grass. Suddenly, the tranquility is shattered by the rustle of leaves. A leopard, sleek and stealthy, has spotted the enormous creature. With a weight advantage of over 11,800 pounds, the elephant seems oblivious to the danger lurking nearby as it continues to munch on grass.

The leopard, weighing in at a mere 176 pounds, knows it can’t overpower the elephant in a direct confrontation. Instead, it relies on its agility and cunning. With a burst of speed, the leopard darts through the grass, staying hidden from the elephant's line of sight. As it draws closer, the leopard crouches low, muscles coiled and ready to spring. The plan? To leap onto the elephant’s back and deliver a surprise attack!

As the leopard springs into action, launching itself towards the elephant, this is where the battle begins. The elephant hears the rustle and instinctively turns, its enormous trunk swinging through the air. The leopard, quick on its feet, narrowly avoids the trunk, landing on the elephant's side. It sinks its powerful jaws into the thick skin, but the elephant's tough hide offers substantial resistance. 

The elephant, now aware of the threat, lets out a trumpet of alarm and begins swinging its trunk wildly to shake off the leopard. With its massive weight and sheer strength, the elephant begins a series of lumbering steps, trying to buck the leopard off. The leopard, agile and quick, attempts to claw its way to a better position but struggles to maintain its grip on the moving giant.

The battle intensifies as the elephant charges forward, trying to throw the leopard off. With each step, the ground shakes, and the leopard must react quickly to avoid being trampled. In a last-ditch effort, the leopard leaps from the side of the elephant, landing gracefully on the ground. The elephant, now enraged and agitated, turns and faces its opponent, preparing to charge again.

As the leopard regains its footing, it realizes the fight is an uphill battle against an animal 68 times its weight. The leopard quickly abandons its attack, choosing instead to retreat to the safety of the trees, where it can climb and escape. The elephant, victorious, stands tall, asserting its dominance in the savanna.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Elephant**

In this epic showdown, the elephant emerges as the clear winner. With a staggering weight of up to 12,000 pounds, it has the strength to withstand the leopard’s attacks. While the leopard's speed of 36 mph is impressive, it simply cannot match the elephant's sheer mass and power. In a direct confrontation, the elephant's thick skin and formidable tusks provide a significant advantage, making it incredibly difficult for the leopard to inflict any serious damage. 

If they were to fight 10 times, the elephant would likely win 9 out of 10 battles. The leopard's agility and speed are its strengths, but in the face of an elephant's sheer size and strength, those advantages become less effective. However, if the battle were to take place in a dense forest where the leopard can climb and use its camouflage to hide, the outcome could be different. The leopard would have a chance to use its stealth and agility to evade the elephant, potentially leading to a different victor in that environment.
