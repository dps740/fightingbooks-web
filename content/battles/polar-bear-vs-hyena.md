### The Hyena

The spotted hyena (*Crocuta crocuta*) is a cunning carnivore found in the savannas, grasslands, and woodlands of Africa.

## The Battle

In a frozen expanse of the Arctic, the sun glimmers off the icy surface, casting long shadows. The polar bear, a formidable figure at 1,500 pounds and 10 feet long, prowls near the edge of the ice. Its powerful legs crunch underfoot, and it scans the horizon for movement. Meanwhile, a lone hyena, weighing in at only 110 pounds, has ventured far from its clan, perhaps searching for food or scouting for danger.

The polar bear spots the hyena from a distance. With a swift burst of speed, it charges forward, its massive paws pounding against the ice. The bear's white fur glistens in the sunlight, making it look like a ghostly apparition as it closes in on its unsuspecting prey. At 25 miles per hour, it’s fast for its size, but the hyena is quick and agile, darting away just in time.

As the polar bear skids to a halt, the hyena circles around, aware that it is outmatched in size. It begins to use its speed, zigzagging across the ice in an attempt to confuse the bear. But the polar bear is not easily fooled; it repositions itself, muscles tensed, ready to strike.

The hyena suddenly lunges forward, snapping its jaws in an attempt to intimidate the bear. With a bite force of 1,100 PSI, it’s a potent adversary in its own right, but the polar bear remains unyielding, its own bite force of 1,200 PSI ready to be unleashed. The hyena darts around the bear, using its agility to stay out of reach, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

In a sudden moment of desperation, the hyena makes a bold move, darting in for a quick bite at the bear’s hind leg. It connects, but the polar bear barely flinches, its thick layers of blubber and fur acting as armor. With a swift, powerful swipe of its massive paw, the polar bear retaliates, sending the hyena sprawling across the ice.

The hyena, now on the defensive, scrambles to get back on its feet. It knows it cannot match the bear in a direct confrontation, so it resorts to its cunning nature, attempting to outsmart the polar bear. It circles back, trying to lure the bear into a vulnerable position. However, the polar bear, with its keen instincts, foresees the hyena's tactics.

With one final charge, the polar bear lunges forward, jaws wide open, ready to deliver a decisive blow. As the hyena attempts to dodge, it trips on the icy surface. In that split second, the polar bear’s powerful bite closes around the hyena, sealing the outcome of this fierce battle.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Polar Bear**

In this epic showdown, the polar bear emerges as the clear victor. With an impressive weight advantage of 1,500 pounds compared to the hyena's 110 pounds, the polar bear's sheer size and strength make it an overwhelming force. Its bite force of 1,200 PSI surpasses that of the hyena, giving it a crucial edge in a direct confrontation. Although the hyena boasts impressive speed at 37 miles per hour, it simply cannot compete with the polar bear in terms of raw power and resilience.

In an estimated 7 out of 10 fights, the polar bear would likely come out on top, overpowering the hyena with its massive size and strength. However, if this battle occurred in a more open environment like the African savanna, the hyena's speed and pack mentality could change the dynamics. In such a scenario, the hyena may have the advantage, especially if it could rally a clan to join in the fight.
