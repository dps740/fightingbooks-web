They rely on their intelligence and social behavior, often fighting to protect their family units.

### The Electric Eel

The electric eel, or *Electrophorus electricus*, is not an eel at all but rather a fish that thrives in the murky freshwater rivers and swamps of the Amazon and Orinoco basins in South America. This remarkable creature is famous for its ability to generate powerful electric shocks, making it a formidable hunter and a unique marvel of nature.

## The Battle

In the heart of a dense jungle, the sun filters through the thick canopy, casting shadows on the forest floor. A massive 400-pound gorilla stands tall, surveying its surroundings with curiosity. Suddenly, a ripple in the water catches its eye. Just below the surface, an 8-foot electric eel glides silently through the murky depths, ready to strike.

With a swift move, the gorilla approaches the water's edge, its strong arms swinging at its sides. The ground trembles beneath the gorilla's feet as it pounds its chest, a display of dominance. The electric eel, sensing the vibration, prepares to defend itself. It knows that the gorilla may seem strong, but it has a secret weapon.

As the gorilla leans closer, the electric eel bursts out of the water, unleashing a powerful shock of 860 volts! The shock travels through the water, and the gorilla pauses, momentarily stunned by the jolt. However, the massive primate quickly regains its footing, its thick fur protecting it somewhat from the shock.

The gorilla charges forward, using its impressive speed of 20 miles per hour. With its long reach of 8 feet, it swings its powerful arms in an attempt to grab the eel. But the electric eel is slippery, darting through the water, evading the gorilla's grasp. It pulses electricity once more, hoping to confuse and incapacitate the great ape.

The gorilla, undeterred, thumps its chest again, letting out a deep roar. It knows it must close the distance to overpower its foe. The eel, sensing the urgency, shoots another electric charge. This time, it successfully hits the gorilla, causing it to stagger back. The gorilla quickly regains its balance but knows it cannot afford to be shocked again.

In a final attempt, the gorilla lunges forward, its massive frame crashing into the water. The electric eel tries to evade, but the gorilla’s sheer weight and strength create a massive splash, momentarily disorienting the eel. At this moment, the gorilla utilizes its powerful jaws and strong arms to grab the eel, pulling it out of the water.

With the electric eel now helpless, the gorilla stands tall, showcasing its victory. The battle, though fierce, has ended with the gorilla's brute strength overpowering the eel's electric defenses.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Gorilla**

The gorilla emerges as the undeniable champion in this thrilling showdown! Weighing in at a staggering 400 pounds, the gorilla's brute strength and impressive speed of 20 miles per hour give it a significant advantage over the electric eel, which weighs only 44 pounds and swims at just 3 mph. While the electric eel's ability to discharge 860 volts is certainly formidable, it simply cannot match the gorilla's size and strength in a direct confrontation.

In 7 out of 10 fights, the gorilla would likely win due to its physical prowess and fighting experience. However, if they were to battle in a different environment, such as the murky waters of the Amazon where the electric eel thrives, the outcome might shift dramatically. In such conditions, the electric eel could utilize its electric shocks more effectively, potentially turning the tide in its favor.
