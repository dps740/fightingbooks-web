## Meet the Fighters

### The Electric Eel

The Electric Eel, scientifically known as *Electrophorus electricus*, is not actually an eel but a type of fish that resides in the murky freshwater rivers and swamps of the Amazon and Orinoco basins in South America. These fascinating creatures have a shocking reputation, both literally and figuratively, as they can deliver stunning electric shocks to incapacitate their prey!

**Physical Stats:**
- **Weight:** 44 pounds
- **Length / Height:** Up to 8 feet long
- **Top Speed:** 3 mph

**Weapons:**
- Can discharge up to 860 volts — enough to stun a horse or knock a human unconscious!
- Three separate electric organs make up 80% of their body — they’re basically a living battery!
- Can pulse electricity to make hidden prey twitch, revealing their hiding spots!

**Fighting Style:**
Electric Eels primarily rely on their electric shocks for hunting and self-defense. They can stealthily approach their prey, then unleash a powerful jolt to stun or immobilize them. Unlike many predators, Electric Eels prefer to hunt solo, using their electric abilities to ambush unsuspecting fish and small mammals.

### The Hyena

The Spotted Hyena, or *Crocuta crocuta*, is a carnivore found in the savannas, grasslands, and woodlands of Africa. These clever creatures are often misunderstood, known for their eerie laugh and scavenging habits. However, they are skilled hunters and often work together in clans to take down larger prey.

**Physical Stats:**
- **Weight:** 90 pounds (approx.)
- **Length / Height:** Up to 5.5 to 6.5 feet long
- **Top Speed:** 37 mph

**Weapons:**
- Powerful jaws with a bite force of 1,100 PSI!
- Sharp claws for gripping and tearing flesh.
- Strong legs for swift running and hunting.

**Fighting Style:**
Hyenas are social animals that often hunt in packs, allowing them to tackle larger prey effectively. They use teamwork to surround and exhaust their targets, making their attacks calculated and strategic. In defense, their thick skin and intimidating laugh can deter potential threats.

## The Battle

The sun sets over the Amazon River, casting golden light on the murky waters where the Electric Eel lurks. With its long, slender body gliding slowly through the water, it senses the presence of a potential intruder. Little does it know, a curious Spotted Hyena has ventured far from its African savanna, having found its way to this exotic locale.

As the hyena pads along the riverbank, it catches a glimpse of the Electric Eel. Intrigued, it approaches the water's edge, unaware of the hidden danger that lies beneath. The Electric Eel, sensing the movement above, prepares to defend its territory. It can pulse electricity like sonar, feeling the vibrations of the hyena's footsteps as it draws closer.

Suddenly, the hyena lunges toward the water, hoping to catch the elusive fish. But the Electric Eel is ready! In a flash, it unleashes a powerful shock, sending a bolt of electricity through the water. The hyena, momentarily startled, feels the jolt travel up its legs, causing its muscles to twitch uncontrollably. It instinctively retreats, shaking off the shock but realizing it’s not facing an ordinary fish.

Regaining its composure, the hyena assesses the situation. It knows it cannot engage in a direct attack from the water, so it circles the riverbank, looking for an opportunity. The Electric Eel, confident in its electric abilities, swims closer to the surface, ready to deliver another shock if necessary. However, it underestimates the hyena’s intelligence and adaptability.

With a sudden burst of speed, the hyena dashes along the bank, trying to flank the Electric Eel. It knows that the eel is slow and cannot escape on land. Just as the hyena leaps toward the water, the eel strikes back, releasing another shock. This time, the hyena is prepared, leaping back to avoid the full brunt of the electric jolt. The electric shock hits the muddy bank, sending sparks flying into the air but missing the hyena.

Determined, the hyena continues to use its cunning, thinking strategically. It realizes that it can’t catch the Electric Eel in the water but can wait for it to surface for air. The Electric Eel must come up every 10 minutes, and the hyena positions itself at a spot where the eel will emerge. As the moments tick by, the tension builds, and both animals prepare for the next phase of their battle.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Electric Eel**

In this electrifying showdown, the Electric Eel takes the crown! With the ability to discharge up to 860 volts, it can incapacitate any creature that dares to come too close. While the hyena boasts a powerful bite force of 1,100 PSI and incredible speed, it cannot match the Electric Eel’s unique defensive weaponry. If these two were to face off in the wild, the Electric Eel would win approximately 7 out of 10 fights, thanks to its shocking abilities.

However, what if they fought in a different environment? If the battle took place on land, the tables might turn. The hyena, with its superior speed and strength, could easily outmaneuver the Electric Eel, making it the likely victor.

**Who is stronger, an Electric Eel or a Hyena?**  
In terms of physical strength and bite force, the hyena is stronger with a bite force of 1,100 PSI. However, the Electric Eel's electrical discharges provide it a unique advantage in combat.

**What are the odds in an Electric Eel vs Hyena fight?**  
In a direct confrontation in the water, the Electric Eel would likely win 7 out of 10 fights. The hyena’s speed and strength would give it an advantage on land, but in the water, the eel's electric shocks would prove too much for the hyena.

**Has an Electric Eel ever fought a Hyena in real life?**
