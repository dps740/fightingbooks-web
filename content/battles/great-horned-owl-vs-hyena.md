This owl is not afraid to tackle animals much larger than itself, defending its territory fiercely.

### The Hyena

The Spotted Hyena, or *Crocuta crocuta*, roams the savannas, grasslands, and woodlands of Africa.

## The Battle

As the sun sets over the African savanna, a Great Horned Owl emerges from the shadows of a nearby tree, its golden eyes scanning the landscape below. With its wings spread wide, it takes to the sky, gliding silently in search of food. Unbeknownst to the owl, a clan of Spotted Hyenas lurks nearby, their sharp senses picking up the slightest movements.

Suddenly, the owl spots a lone hyena straying from the pack. It swoops down, its wings cutting through the air with barely a sound. The hyena, however, senses danger and turns just in time to see the massive bird descending upon it. With a quick leap, the hyena dodges the owl's talons, feeling the rush of wind as they just miss its back.

The Great Horned Owl quickly regains its composure and circles back, ready for another attempt. It knows that its strength lies in its silent approach and powerful talons. As it dives again, the hyena prepares, recognizing the owl's strategy. With a powerful push-off from its strong legs, the hyena sprints forward, hoping to outmaneuver the aerial predator.

Just as the owl descends for its strike, the hyena rolls, using its sharp claws to swipe at the owl's legs. The owl flaps its wings, lifting itself just out of reach, but not without losing some feathers in the process. Enraged, the owl lets out a fierce hoot, asserting its dominance in the battle. The hyena, undeterred, lets out a chilling laugh that echoes across the plains, calling its clan for backup.

Now, with the odds shifting, the Great Horned Owl faces a new challenge. As more hyenas arrive, the owl realizes it may be outmatched. It tries to maintain its aerial advantage, swooping down to strike at the closest hyena, but the pack begins to coordinate their movements, flanking the owl and forcing it to keep a wary eye in multiple directions.

The hyenas, working as a unit, start to leap and snap at the owl as it tries to evade their attacks. The Great Horned Owl, despite its impressive flying abilities, struggles to maintain its advantage against the sheer numbers of the hyena clan. In a final desperate attempt, the owl dives towards the ground, hoping to escape through the brush. But the hyenas are quick, and one brave hyena launches itself forward, catching the owl by surprise and landing a bite on its wing.

With a flurry of feathers, the Great Horned Owl fights back, talons striking at the hyena, but the combined weight of the clan overwhelms it. The owl, once a silent hunter of the night, finds itself at the mercy of the pack, and with one final, powerful bite from the lead hyena, the battle comes to a close.

## The Verdict

**Winner: Hyena**

The Spotted Hyena emerges victorious in this intense battle, showcasing its strength, teamwork, and tactical prowess. With a weight of 110 pounds and a jaw strength of 1,100 PSI, the hyena had the physical advantage over the Great Horned Owl, which weighs only 5.5 pounds and has a bite force of 300 PSI. Although the owl's silent flight and diving speed of 40 mph are impressive, they were not enough to outmatch the hyena's pack strategy and raw power. In a contest of 10 fights, the hyena would likely win 8 out of 10 times.

However, what if they battled in a dense forest? In that scenario, the Great Horned Owl could use its camouflage and stealth to its advantage, potentially ambushing the hyenas in the darkness. In such an environment, the odds could flip, giving the owl a fighting chance!
