## The "Fan Site" Formula

1. **Find the superfans** — What do people OBSESS over?
2. **Find the gap** — What do they want that doesn't exist?
3. **Build the bridge** — Give them more of what they love
4. **Support the original** — Affiliate links, tributes, drive sales
5. **Scale with content** — SEO articles, social, email

FightingBooks is the template. Apply it to other niches.
