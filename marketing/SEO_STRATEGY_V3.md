---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) — SCOUT EXECUTES

### 1.1 Cornerstone Content (Scout creates this week)

**Page 1: Ultimate Who Would Win Book Guide** (`/books` or `/guide`)
- All 35+ official books with covers
- Publication order AND recommended reading order
- Lexile levels and grade recommendations for each
- Age appropriateness notes
- "If you liked X, try Y" recommendations
- Amazon affiliate links (when David sets up Associates account)
- **Word count: 4,000+**
- **CTA: Email signup + "Make your own matchup" button**

**Page 2: Books Like Who Would Win** (`/books/similar` or `/alternatives`)
- Position FightingBooks as THE answer
- Other series: National Geographic Kids, Animal Battles series
- Why our custom books fill the gap
- **Word count: 2,500+**
- **CTA: Generate custom book**

**Page 3: Who Would Win Classroom Resources** (`/classroom`)
- Downloadable PDF lesson plans (Scout creates)
- Discussion questions for each book
- Compare/contrast writing templates
- Science standards alignment (NGSS)
- **This is our backlink magnet**
- **CTA: Download free PDF (email required)**

### 1.2 Technical SEO (Scout executes)

- [x] Dynamic sitemap.xml ✅ DONE
- [x] robots.ts ✅ DONE
- [ ] Add Article schema to all battle pages
- [ ] Add FAQ schema to all battle pages  
- [ ] Add Book schema to book guide page
- [ ] Add llms.txt for AI crawlers

- [ ] Create /about page with real information
- [ ] Verify all images have alt text

### 1.3 Conversion Funnel (Scout implements)

Every page needs:
1. **Email capture** — "Get notified when we add new battles"
2. **Primary CTA** — "Create Your Own Battle Book"
3. **Secondary CTA** — "Browse All Battles" or "See Book Guide"

**Email capture placement:**

## Phase 2: Content Quality Upgrade (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Battle Page Improvements

Current: 16 battle pages exist
Problem: May be thin content, missing visuals, inconsistent quality

**Scout audits and improves each page:**

| Element | Current | Target |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Word count | ~1,500 | 2,000+ |
| Unique analysis | Minimal | 400+ words of original insight |
| Images | 0 | 3+ (comparison, both animals, size chart) |
| FAQ section | Some | All pages, 5+ questions |
| Sources | Inconsistent | All stats cited |
| Internal links | Few | 5+ to related battles |
| CTA | Weak | Clear "Make this book" button |

**Priority pages to upgrade first (highest search volume):**
1. lion-vs-tiger
2. gorilla-vs-bear
3. tiger-vs-bear
4. hippo-vs-rhino
5. polar-bear-vs-grizzly-bear

### 2.2 Image Strategy

**Scout creates/sources for each battle page:**
1. Hero image — Both animals (AI-generated via Flux, we have this)
2. Size comparison — Human silhouette + both animals to scale
3. Individual animal photos — Wikimedia Commons (free, cited)

**Image optimization:**
- WebP format
- Descriptive alt text with keywords
- Lazy loading

### 2.3 Remove Fiction, Add Facts

Current battle pages have speculative "battle scenario" sections that read as fiction.

**Fix:** Replace with:
- Historical encounters (documented, with dates and sources)
- Expert analysis from wildlife biologists (real quotes, linked sources)
- Scientific comparison of capabilities
- Clear verdict based on evidence

---

## Phase 3: Link Building (Week 3-4, ongoing)

### 3.1 Classroom Resource Outreach

**Target:** Teacher blogs, homeschool forums, education resource sites

**Approach:**
1. Create genuinely useful PDF (lesson plans, worksheets)
2. Find bloggers who've written about Who Would Win books
3. Email: "Free classroom resource for Who Would Win — thought your readers might find it useful"

**Scout prepares:**
- PDF lesson plan (downloadable)
- List of 20 target blogs/sites
- Outreach email template

### 3.2 Fan Community Positioning (Not Competitor)

**Reframe:** We're not replacing Jerry Pallotta's books. We're the fan community that celebrates them AND lets fans explore matchups Jerry hasn't written yet.

**Jerry Pallotta outreach (lower priority, Month 2):**
- Only after we have substantial content
- Position as "fan resource that drives book sales"
- Offer to add his affiliate links
- Accept that this probably won't work (5-10% chance)

### 3.3 Passive Link Earning

- Submit to educational resource directories
- Answer Quora questions about Who Would Win books
- Create Wikipedia-worthy content (complete book list)
- HARO responses for kids/education/books queries

---

## Phase 4: Scale Content (Month 2-3)

### 4.1 New Battle Pages (Quality over Quantity)

**Target: 50-80 total pages (not 200+)**

Each page must have:
- 2,000+ words
- 400+ words of unique human analysis
- 3+ images
- 5+ FAQ questions
- All stats sourced
- Clear CTA

**Keyword targeting (Tier 3 first):**

| Keyword | Est. Volume | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| wolf vs hyena who would win | 3,000 | Week 4 |
| jaguar vs leopard who would win | 2,500 | Week 4 |
| anaconda vs crocodile who would win | 2,000 | Exists |
| komodo dragon vs king cobra | 1,500 | Exists |
| honey badger vs lion | 1,500 | Exists |
| wolverine vs honey badger | 1,000 | Week 5 |
| cheetah vs leopard | 1,000 | Week 5 |

### 4.2 Animal Database (Scout builds)

JSON database of 50+ animals with verified stats:
- Weight, length, height
- Speed, bite force
- Weapons (claws, teeth, venom, etc.)
- Habitat, diet, lifespan
- **Source URL for every stat**

This enables:
- Consistent stats across all pages
- Auto-generated comparison tables
- Fact-checking against sources

---

## Phase 5: Distribution Channels (Month 3+)

### 5.1 YouTube Shorts (Optional, Month 4+)

- 60-second "Who Would Win?" verdict videos
- AI voiceover + stock/AI footage
- Link to full article
- Low effort if tooling exists

### 5.2 Pinterest

- Who Would Win book covers
- Battle infographics
- Links to articles
- Good for parent/teacher audience

### 5.3 Email Newsletter

- Weekly "Battle of the Week"
- New matchup announcements
- Drives return visits (SEO signal)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Jerry Pallotta trademark concern | Position as fan resource, link to his books, don't use "Who Would Win" in domain... wait, we do. Monitor for issues. |
| Google algorithm update | Diversify: email list, social, direct traffic |
| Competition enters niche | First-mover advantage, build authority fast |
| Content quality issues | Human review of all pages, no thin content |

---

## Not Doing (Explicitly Rejected)

- ❌ Fake author personas
- ❌ 200+ thin programmatic pages
- ❌ Targeting "lion vs tiger" in year 1
- ❌ Relying on Jerry Pallotta partnership
- ❌ Paid ads before organic works
