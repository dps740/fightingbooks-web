### Description (260 chars max)

### Maker Comment (First Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built this because my kid is obsessed with Jerry Pallotta's "Who Would Win?" books. If you're not familiar — they're these brilliant children's books that pit two animals against each other, teach real facts about both, then crown a winner.

The problem? There are 35+ books, but kids always want MORE matchups. "Dad, what about Gorilla vs. Grizzly Bear?" "Who wins — Hippo or Rhino?"

So I built FightingBooks:

🦁 Pick any two animals (real, extinct, or mythical)
📊 Get real researched facts about each
⚔️ Read an epic battle narrative
🏆 See who wins (based on actual biology)
📖 Flip through like a real book, or download PDF

**What's free:** Popular matchups like Lion vs. Tiger, Shark vs. Crocodile
**What costs $1:** Custom animals your kid dreams up

It's a fan tribute to Jerry Pallotta's work — we actually link to his books and encourage people to buy the originals. This just fills the gap for matchups he hasn't written yet.

Would love feedback from parents, teachers, or anyone who remembers arguing about animal battles as a kid! 🙋

## Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT?**
A: It's formatted as an actual children's book with illustrations, proper structure (intro, stats, battle, winner), and a flip-book reader. ChatGPT gives you a wall of text. This gives you something you can read with your kid or print and keep.

**Q: Any plans for more features?**
A: We're working on:
- Tournament mode (8-animal bracket)
- Choose Your Own Adventure battles
- Classroom bulk accounts for teachers
- Print-on-demand physical books

**Q: Is the science accurate?**
A: We research real data — size, weight, habitat, diet, weapons/defenses. The battle outcome is speculative but grounded in actual biology. We cite the same kind of facts Jerry Pallotta uses.

**Q: Legal concerns with the "Who Would Win" comparison?**
A: We're a fan tribute, clearly labeled as unofficial. We actively drive traffic to Jerry's books via affiliate links. Similar to how fan fiction works — inspired by, not competing with.

Hey [Name],

I'm launching a side project on Product Hunt tomorrow and could use some support.

It's called FightingBooks — a tool that creates custom "Who Would Win?" style animal battle books for kids. Think Lion vs. Tiger, but any matchup your kid wants.

1. Go to [Product Hunt link]
2. Click the upvote button (you'll need to log in)
3. Leave a quick comment if you're feeling generous

Early momentum matters a lot on Product Hunt, so even just an upvote helps.
