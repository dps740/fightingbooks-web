## Integration Needed

Once site is stable:
1. Add blog/articles section to site
2. Implement new homepage copy
3. Add affiliate links (need Amazon Associates account)
4. Set up analytics tracking
5. Create battle page template

---

## Notes

- Amazon affiliate links use placeholder `?tag=AFFILIATE` - replace with real tag
- All content written for SEO but readable/valuable
- Reddit posts need David to post from his account
- Product Hunt needs David's account to launch
