### Title:
My kid finished all the "Who Would Win?" books and kept asking for matchups that don't exist — so I made a tool to create them

### Body:
If your kids are anything like mine, they're obsessed with Jerry Pallotta's "Who Would Win?" series. You know the ones — Lion vs. Tiger, Shark vs. Killer Whale, etc.

The problem is there are "only" 35 books, and my kid blew through them in a few months. Then came the endless questions: "What about Gorilla vs. Grizzly Bear?" "Who wins — Hippo or Crocodile?"

So I built a little web tool that generates custom battle books in the same style:

- Pick any two animals
- Get real facts about each one
- Read a battle narrative
- Find out who wins

It's free for popular matchups (Lion vs. Tiger, etc.) and $1 for custom animals.

Thought other parents might find it useful. My kid has generated like 30 of these things so far.

### Title:
Built a "Who Would Win?" book generator because my kid asked me "Gorilla vs. Bear — who wins?" one too many times

### Body:
Fellow dads, you know the Jerry Pallotta books? The animal battle ones?

My kid is OBSESSED. We've bought like 20 of them. But there aren't enough matchups for his appetite.

Every day: "Dad, what about Wolverine vs. Honey Badger?" "Who would win — a Moose or a Bison?"

So I did what any reasonable engineer dad would do: I spent a weekend building an AI tool that generates custom battle books.

You pick two animals, it researches real facts about both, writes a battle scene, and picks a winner based on actual biology.

My kid thinks it's magic. My wife thinks I have too much free time. Both are correct.

Hi moms! My kids love the "Who Would Win?" book series by Jerry Pallotta, but they always want matchups that don't exist in the series.

I made a simple tool that lets them create their own:

1. Pick any two animals

3. Read an illustrated battle
4. Find out who wins

It's educational (real animal facts) and keeps them entertained. They've been making books for their favorite matchup debates.

## r/Teachers

### Title:
Free tool for animal research projects — students create "Who Would Win?" style comparison books

### Body:
Hey fellow educators,

I built a tool that might be useful for science or reading classes: a "Who Would Win?" style book generator.

Students pick two animals, and it generates a comparison book with:
- Facts about each animal (size, habitat, diet, adaptations)
- Side-by-side "tale of the tape" comparison
- A narrative "battle" (age-appropriate, not graphic)
- A winner based on the evidence

**Classroom applications:**
- Compare/contrast writing exercises
- Animal research projects
- Reluctant reader engagement
- Critical thinking (do they agree with the outcome?)

It's based on Jerry Pallotta's popular book series, which many of your students probably know.

Free for common animals, let me know if you'd want bulk/classroom pricing.

### Title:
Free educational tool — custom "Who Would Win?" animal battle books

### Body:
Hi homeschool families!

We use Jerry Pallotta's "Who Would Win?" books for science/reading, but my kid always wants matchups that don't exist.

Built a tool to create custom ones:
- Real researched facts about each animal
- Compare/contrast format
- Engaging narrative
- Critical thinking opportunity (agree/disagree with winner)

It covers biology concepts naturally — habitats, adaptations, predator/prey relationships, size comparisons.

My kids now do "research" by making these books about animals they're curious about.

Free for popular animals: [link]

## r/books

### Title:
Made a fan tool for Jerry Pallotta's "Who Would Win?" series — create custom animal battle matchups

### Body:
Any fans of Jerry Pallotta's "Who Would Win?" children's book series here?

My family loves these books — they're educational animal comparison books where two creatures face off and you learn real facts about both before finding out who would win.

The series has 35+ books now, but there are infinite possible matchups kids want to see.

Built a fan tool that generates custom battles in the same style. Pick any two animals, get a fully illustrated book with real facts. It's a tribute to Jerry's work — we even link to his books and encourage people to buy the originals.

Thought other fans might enjoy making matchups Jerry hasn't written yet.
